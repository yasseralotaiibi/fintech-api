- `openapi.yaml` exposes the mocked AIS/PIS-compliant endpoints for the MVP, including CIBA, consent, and mock national connectors.
- Serve the specification via `/docs` when running the API, or load the YAML into Stoplight/SwaggerHub.
- Expand the specification with error codes, schemas, and connector payloads as integration matures.
